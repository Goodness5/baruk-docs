## 🛠️ What We're Building

At its core, Baruk AI is a trading protocol on Sei's fast and scalable network, enabling secure and efficient management of digital assets. We're fine-tuning **OpenAI's GPT-OSS model** on Sei blockchain data to create a native AI agent that understands the ecosystem and powers autonomous trading. With **Privy integration**, onboarding is as simple as signing up with an email or social account—no seed phrases or complex wallet setups required.

### Current Progress
- **Trading Protocol**: In development for fast, secure transactions on Sei.  
- **AI Agent**: Actively fine-tuning GPT-OSS for Sei-native intelligence.  
- **Privy Integration**: Simplifying sign-ups with account abstraction.
